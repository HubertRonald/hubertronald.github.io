## Purpose

Prompts translate structured RetainAI context into bounded, reviewable advisor
output.

## Prompt contract

Prompts should define:

```text
role
task
input schema
allowed evidence
output schema
failure behavior
safety constraints
locale
```

## Structured output

Prefer validated structured responses:

```json
{
  "recommendation_key": "advisor.action.review_manager_context",
  "rationale_keys": [],
  "evidence": [],
  "limitations": [],
  "confidence": null
}
```

## Evidence grounding

Provider output must reference supplied evidence and must not invent employee,
resume, psychometric, or organizational facts.

## Provider abstraction

Supported adapter states:

```text
disabled
gemini
bedrock
```

Prompt templates should not depend on a provider-specific response format.

## Localization

Prompt and explanation architecture must support:

```text
en
es
```

The backend should return stable message keys and variables where possible. The
dashboard renders localized text.

## Safety and review

Outputs remain advisory and reviewable. Prompts must not authorize autonomous
high-impact employment decisions.

## Versioning and evaluation

Track:

```text
prompt version
provider
model identifier
locale
input schema
output schema
evaluation dataset
quality results
```
